<p>
This game is called Penguin. Here are the
controls. The penguin will follow your 
mouse, and will eat the apples if you
press E. It will play with the ball if you 
press  p, and will swim (only at the beach)
You can change the scene with the arrow
keys, and go back to the instructions with
 the right arrow. You can go to the beach with the 
down arrow, the winter scene with the left arrow,
and the mountain slopes with the up arrow. 
Note: Press the left arrow key after you're done with
the instructions. If you do otherwise, the 
penguin will not appear.
