<h1> Zelda project 1</h1>
<body>
<p> You do not need to press any buttons, besides the green flag. Screens and items will switch automatically. There are 5 screens: Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass, and Spirit Tracks. They all play a song from their game. If you are going to stop it, please stop it once you have heard all of the music, at the Majora's Mask screen again. If you don't, the whole process will be messed up.
